# Pneumonia-classification
This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for the classification of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The project aims to develop an accurate and robust model that can assist medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia by leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset from Kaggle. It includes a comprehensive collection of de-identified chest radiographs from pediatric patients, annotated with bounding boxes indicating lung opacities associated with pneumonia. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, providing a solid foundation for training and evaluating machine learning models for pneumonia detection. For more information, visit the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge on Kaggle.

### Downloading the dataset
```bash
kaggle competitions download -c rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge
```

### Unzipping the dataset
```bash
