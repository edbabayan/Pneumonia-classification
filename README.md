# Pneumonia-classification
This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for the classification of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The project aims to develop an accurate and robust model that can assist medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia by leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
